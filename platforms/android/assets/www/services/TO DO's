APP TO DO's

have a loading gif and a modal response when you click START on home page

fix the sidebar, choosing pitcher doesn't work

fix the "areYouDone" modal, doesn't pop up, doesn't show error message

make the sanitize function in DataService.save() into a recursive function that goes over the whole data object and returns the sanitized object

add a "SAVING" spinner when done with pulls, prior to pushing DONE

the function to detect need for 3rd pull is not right

seems to be an issue with saving main mainValue to Stamplay (it shows as 0; maybe a rounding up in view?)

need to update $rootScope.currBaseline once a pull is complete

shorten the unique id for pitchers

get instructions text from Damian

make the right sidebar into a list without the 3 dots button

unit tests



ADMIN APP TO DO'S

the big chart to anyalyze a pitcher's data

hide the pulls field in Pitching_Data model; Damian doesn't want to see raw data, 



TEAM APP TO DO'S

interceptor for team doesn't work (permanent filter so login only shows team info)
