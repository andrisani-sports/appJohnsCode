DONE 	fix the sidebar, choosing pitcher doesn't work

DONE 	have a loading gif when you click START on home page

DONE 	have a modal response if bluetooth connection doesn't happen

DONE 	fix the "areYouDone" modal, doesn't pop up, doesn't show error message

DONE 	the function to detect need for 3rd pull is not right

DONE 	need to fix the pull counter, it's showing a 3rd pull even if not needing a 3rd

DONE 	make the right sidebar into a list without the 3 dots button

need to update $rootScope.currBaseline once a pull is complete

seems to be an issue with saving main mainValue to Stamplay (it shows as 0; maybe a rounding up in view?)

the right sidebar isn't showing anything if no wifi when app opens, should get cache

add a "SAVING" modal (spinner?) when done with pulls, then automically disconnect, no need to push button (or push it so they have time to see results?)

shorten the unique id for pitchers (see function that Steve put in)

get instructions text from Damian

make the sanitize function in DataService.save() into a recursive function that goes over the whole data object and returns the sanitized object

unit tests



ADMIN APP TO DO'S

the big chart to anyalyze a pitcher's data

hide the pulls field in Pitching_Data model; Damian doesn't want to see raw data, 



TEAM APP TO DO'S

interceptor for team doesn't work (permanent filter so login only shows team info)
